# Vue GraphQL Models

Universal library which helps to build OOP-driven GraphQL based models for Vue components.
Influenced by Laravel Eloquent Models & Collections.

![Travis](https://api.travis-ci.org/digitalideastudio/vue-graphql-models.svg?branch=master) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/digitalideastudio/vue-graphql-models/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/digitalideastudio/vue-graphql-models)

## Features

* `BaseModel` is a class which acts as a base entity for your future models extending this class.
* Full encapsulation of GraphQL queries & mutations. No need to call them manually, all you need is to call you Model's `.get()` or `.find()` methods.
* All arrays retrieved from GraphQL will be hydrated with respectful collections of models.
* Supports lazy-loading of GraphQL documents.
* Supports evens & hooks for customization.
* Has built-in FormWizard factory so you can create simple or complex Forms.
* Has built-in support for your application's menus in OOP manner. 

###### Internally:  
* Webpack 4 based.
* ES6 as a source.
* Exports in a [umd](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) format so library works everywhere.
* ES6 test setup with [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](http://chaijs.com/).
* Linting with [ESLint](http://eslint.org/).
